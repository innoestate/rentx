Ok i have a nice structure respecting separation of concerns for the features.

Now i'd like to go deeper in the global structure.

So we have a core forlder to handler global logic for all like auth, guards etc...
A shared module to handle stuffs used in different features
We also have UI that provide all ui components used for displaying stuffs.

And we have a views folder that display pages and components.
In this folder we have desktop, and mobile.
Also common...but this name is not very good.
